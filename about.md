Two things you should know about me; The first is that I have overcome any obstacle that I set my mind to. The second is that I am unexpectedly good with computers.

I continually pursue my passion for knowledge and all things data. I learn, unlearn, relearn, repeat and try to have some fun along the way. Step 1 is to become a Data Scientist / Machine Learning Engineer. Step 2 is to change the world.
