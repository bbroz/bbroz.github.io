Two things you should know about me; The first is that my career path up to this point has not been linear. The second is that I am unexpectedly good with computers.

I continually pursue my passion for knowledge and all things data. I learn, unlearn, relearn, and repeat. Step one is to become a Data Scientist. Step two is to identify and tackle new and interesting problems. All while also having some fun along the way.
